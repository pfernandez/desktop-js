# Desktop JS

**The opinion here is that there is no opinion**

This is a minimal set of packages to get a Node.js/HTML5 desktop app up and running ASAP. It is not a framework; you can structure your code however you see fit.

More packages will probably be added from time to time, but at the moment it's simply:

- [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) - Node with a custom Chromium frontend
- [ractive](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive) - HTML templating and DOM manipulation 

## To Use
