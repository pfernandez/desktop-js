# Desktop JS

**The opinion here is that there is no opinion**

This is a core set of packages to get a Node.js/HTML5 desktop app up and running ASAP, based on [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start). It is not a framework. You can structure your code however you see fit, and the tools are there to back you up.

More packages may be added from time to time. At the moment it's:

- [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) - Node with a custom Chromium frontend
- [ractive](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive) - HTML templating and DOM manipulation
- [less](http://lesscss.org/) - CSS preprocessor
- [electron-reload](https://github.com/yan-foto/electron-reload) - Automatic browser reloads
